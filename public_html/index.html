            <img src="s.png" style="width:150px;height:150px"> <p> I go to pasadena high school. I am in the 10th grade. I am a very athletic person.</p>
            <p>My favorite subject in school is computer designing. I chose computer because </p> <p> first
                of all you get your own computer to use and also u get to design your own website's </p> 
            <p>and it is very challenging.</p> 
                                          
            <img src="z.png" style="width:150px;height:150px">  <p> My favorite drink is thai iced tea. Thai tea in Thailand, is a drink made from strongly brewed Ceylon tea. </p>
                                    q                           <p> However, due to Ceylon tea's high price, a locally grown landrace version of Assam known as Bai Miang with added food coloring is commonly used. </p> 
                                                                <p> Other ingredients may include added orange blossom water, star anise, crushed tamarind seed or red and yellow food coloring, and sometimes other spices as well.</p> 
                                                                <p>This tea is sweetened with sugar and condensed milk and served chilled. </p> 
                                                                <p> Evaporated milk, coconut milk or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving to add taste and creamy appearance. </p>
